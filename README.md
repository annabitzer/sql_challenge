Data Analysis: An employee database from a fictional company was organized and analyzed as part of the Data Analytics Bootcamp SQL module challenge. The first step in this analysis was to develop an ERD, showing the relationship between the six datasets that make up this database. Using this diagram to determine which columns in each dataset were primary keys and foreign keys to other datasets, SQL was used to create tables for each dataset and import the data from the corresponding CSV. In pgAdmin, a series of queries were then written to answer questions about the database. 

Data Cleaning Note: In the departments.csv file, I noticed that dept_no and dept_name were all in quotation marks. Using find and replace in excel, I removed the quotations before starting on data analysis to keep the data consistent with the other csv files.
